# PapaHub
* This plugin was the first one i made alone when i learn how to make cores, i put it public for all those people who likes to skid or learn how to make it and those people who need a hubcore.

* The code was 60% cleaned up, you could still find some simple bugs probably u can fix it if ur gonna use this.

* This is the defenitive version and could not get updates if u need help make a issue.

# Support
* This hub is made for 1.8 probably could support 1.7 and others but i didnt finish at all this core.
